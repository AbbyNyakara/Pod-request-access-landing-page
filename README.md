## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS Preprocessor 

### What I learned

I've learned about unitless values to line-height property and these are better options to avoid rare comportaments in the page.

Also, I've learned is a good practice to define width and height in the img tag to avoid unexpected changes in the layout.

### Continued development

Keep improving my knowledge about JavaScript, Sass and accessibility.
